# Instant-Tele-Emergency-Alarm-Module---iTEAM
MICROCONTROLLERS AND EMBEDDED SYSTEMS project ARM LPC2148  
This project aims to propose and build a state-of-the-art technology called the Instant Tele-Emergency Alarm Module - iTEAM used for automatic calling and messaging service to the nearest FIRE-STATION during a fire breakout in a hospital. The same device can be used in hospitals to contact a doctor through a Call or SMS during emergency cases. This device uses GSM Technology based on Cellular Networks which does not require internet services for its operation, thus, can be installed in all the remote locations across the country.
